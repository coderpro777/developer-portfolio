    description1: "Hello! My name is Ricardo Alvarado. I'm a certified web developer based in Florida, USA.",
    description2: "I have a bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems Engineering, Certified Fullstack Web-Developer. A project that I worked on towards the end of my Bachelorâ€™s set me on this path of a web developer. The project involved making an e-learning platform  that could be considered as an educational tool for 2 rural communities in Ecuador on the subject of digital literacy. The website was not the focus of the project, but working on it was such a thrilling experience that a career in this felt like a right fit. Other than this I like learning about the lastest technologies for mobile and web development.",
